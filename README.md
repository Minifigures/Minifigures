# About Me

👋 Hey there! I’m Marco Anthony Ayuste, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto Mississauga, double majoring in Communication, Culture & Information Technology (CCIT) and Sociology.

💻 I build and ship web projects, I care a lot about clean UI/UX, performance, and maintainable code
🧪 I’m interested in Software Engineering, QA automation, and product engineering, especially where reliability and great UX overlap
🤖 I’m also exploring AI tooling (chatbots, prompt engineering, and Google Cloud learning like Vertex AI Studio)
🛠️ Tech I use: JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, Git/GitHub, Netlify/Vercel, Google Workspace, Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
📈 I’m comfortable with data tracking and analysis (Sheets/Excel workflows, KPIs, structured documentation)
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects involving front-end, back-end, UI/UX, automation, or sociotechnical work
📫 How to reach me: https://minifigures.github.io
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
🏋️ Fun fact: I bench press and deadlift more than I weigh, and I’m into anime, gym sessions, billiards, concerts, sunsets, and trying new food spots

🚀 Thanks for stopping by!
